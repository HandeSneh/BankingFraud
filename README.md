# Multiprocessing:

Multiprocessing allows you to run multiple processes concurrently on a multi-core system. This can significantly speed up tasks that can be broken down into smaller, independent subtasks.
Multiprocessing in Python is a built-in library that allows you to leverage multiple processes on a multi-core system to execute tasks concurrently. This can significantly improve the performance of your Python code, especially for tasks that can be broken down into smaller, independent subtasks.\
Key Concepts: \
1.Process: An instance of a program being executed. \
2.Multiprocessing: Running multiple processes simultaneously. \
3.Multiprocessing Module: A Python library that provides tools for managing multiple processes.\
4.Pool: A collection of worker processes that can execute tasks concurrently.\
5.Queue/Manager: Tools to share data between processes.\
