**Multiprocessing:
**Multiprocessing allows you to run multiple processes concurrently on a multi-core system. This can significantly speed up tasks that can be broken down into smaller, independent subtasks.
Multiprocessing in Python is a built-in library that allows you to leverage multiple processes on a multi-core system to execute tasks concurrently. This can significantly improve the performance of your Python code, especially for tasks that can be broken down into smaller, independent subtasks.
Key Concepts:
Process: An instance of a program being executed.
Multiprocessing: Running multiple processes simultaneously.
Multiprocessing Module: A Python library that provides tools for managing multiple processes.
Pool: A collection of worker processes that can execute tasks concurrently.
Queue/Manager: Tools to share data between processes.
